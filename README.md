# Paintjob Tracker
This is a little tool I wrote to help me manage all of my paintjob packs, letting me auto-generate descriptions in a handful of formats (Steam Workshop, SCS Forums, plain text etc) as well as package a mod's files into a .zip, automatically named with the mod's version number (or "universal" for Workshop uploading). It uses an .ini file generated by a seeecret setting in [Paintjob Packer](https://github.com/Carsmaniac/paintjob-packer).

Maintaining mods on a bunch of different websites is an administrative nightmare when you want to make things look pretty everywhere, so Paintjob Tracker will hopefully lower the barrier to entry enough for me to actually upload my mods to multiple places, instead of just to the Workshop.

I designed this tool solely for my own use, so it likely won't get any polish/customisability/official releases, but I figured I'd make it public in case there's something you can learn from the code. Thanks for checking it out :)
